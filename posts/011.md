# Arduino, meet DevOps

Lately my tasks at work have been focused on maturing our existing DevOps stack. The experience has really been incredible. There are some interesting problems to solve and quite a few great tools out there to utilize. Ive had the chance to prototype/iterate with [Capistrano](http://www.capistranorb.com/), [Fabric](http://fabfile.org), and [Salt](http://saltstack.com/) to name a few. (We opted for the latter two in the end)  

On the homefront, I've had a chance to screw around with my new [Sparkfun Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11227) and dip my feet in the addicting world of nodebot prototyping. Its been a lot of fun, well... as much fun as blinking LEDs can get... which is *really* fun.  

As the Frankenstein's DevOps monster that I built at work began to stabilize, in my off-hours I decided to design and implement a web-based utility on top of our existing toolchain (Django was my framework of choice). A side-benefit gleaned from this effort was unexpected but incredibly useful: web hooks that tied directly to our release orchestration processes.  

These web hooks seemed to be a perfect target candidate for the holy grail of any DevOps engineer: push-button release orchestration. So I took a couple of hours one weekend to build out a very basic module, which sends out HTTP requests at the push of a button.  

End result: about 50 lines of JavaScript and some sweet blinking status LEDs are now capable of doing software releases here at [Aereo](https://aereo.com).Â

And the (rather unspectacular) code...

```js
"use strict";

var five = require("johnny-five"),
    http = require("http"),
    board = new five.Board();

board.on("ready", function() {

    var yellow_led  = five.Led(13),
        red_led     = five.Led(12),
        button      = five.Button(3);

    function busy(on) {
        if (on === undefined) {
            on = true;
        }
        if (on) {
            yellow_led.off();
            red_led.strobe();
        } else {
            yellow_led.on();
            red_led.off();
        }
    }

    function error() {
        red_led.stop();
        yellow_led.off();
        red_led.on();
    }

    setTimeout(function(){
        yellow_led.on();
        button.on("down", function() {

            busy();

            var options = {
                host: 'hostname',
                port: '80',
                path: '/release/'
            };
            var req = http.get(options, function(res) {
                res.setEncoding('utf8');
                res.on('data', function (chunk) {
                    console.log('Response: ' + chunk);
                    if (res.statusCode == 404) {
                        error();
                    } else {
                        busy(false);
                    }
                });
            }).on('error', function(e) {
                console.log('ERROR: ' + e.message);
                error();
            });

        });
    }, 1000);

});
```
