# Wontmerge.com: Much Snark, Very Wow

We all love denying pull requests, so why waste time with words?

This weekend I created [wontmerge.com](http://wontmerge.com)Â for that very purpose. Its just a tiny nodejs/express app hosted on Heroku ([Github](https:/github.com/spmurrayzzz/wontmerge.com)).

Snarky open source contributions are still cool, right?
