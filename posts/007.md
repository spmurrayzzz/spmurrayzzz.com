# RIP Malcom T.

It was announced yesterday that [Malcom Tredinnick passed away](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/mar/19/goodbye-malcolm/). Very few details about his passing have been released out of respect for his family, so I won't talk about the various rumours I've read discussing the cause.

Being so new to Django it feels a little strange to be affected by this in any profound way, but as anyone who has spent any time hacking around Django's ORM code knows that Malcom's `codeprint` can be found all over the place. I recently spent some time debugging a weird unicode issue in templates which basically lead me to all Malcom's pre-1.0 ORM commits. I quickly came to the realization [after seeing his name everywhere in the commit log](https://github.com/django/django/commits?author=malcolmt) that he was, in fact, the juggernaut of Django's ORM implementation.

Having never interacted with Malcolm directly, I can't really extend any praise about his character as I simply did not know him personally. But as someone who is trying very hard to give back to the Open Source community through contributions, I understand how difficult it can be to get started in that world. Everything I've ever read about Malcolm has consistently praised his stalwart efforts to ensure that all willing developers can become contributers -- everyone, in his mind, has something of value to add.

I'll do my best to follow his example.
