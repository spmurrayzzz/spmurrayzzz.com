  <h1 class="tk-futura-pt">about me</h1>
  <p>
    On the professional side of things, I'm a web developer based in
    Boston where I was born and raised. I specialize in building
    high-fidelity web and mobile web applications. Passionate about the
    open web and its supporting community, whether it's in the browser or
    Node.js, I opt to spend my days hacking in JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work I am an avid bio-hacker, nutrition dork, drummer,
    former touring band dude, dog owner/lover, and Certified Party
    Animal™. I prefer to read rather than watch, walk rather than run,
    thrive rather than survive, and fail rather than not try.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am presently employed as
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenpmurray" target="_blank">Lead Software
      Engineer</a>, a member of the founding team at
    <a href="http://www.projectdecibel.com" target="_blank">Project Decibel</a>.
    We're a core group from same team that was responsible for developing
    and launching Aereo.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that sounds interesting to you and you love JavaScript — we should
    talk, I'm hiring.
