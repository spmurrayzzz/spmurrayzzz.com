<section class="about">
  <h1 class="tk-futura-pt">about me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a senior software engineer based in Boston where I was born and raised.
    I spent my late teens and early twenties touring in bands as a drummer and
    finding work as a freelance web developer along the way. These days I find
    myself hacking on rad technology and building great teams at startups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work I am an avid bio-hacker, nutrition dork, dog
    owner/lover, and Certified Party Animal™. I prefer to read rather than
    watch, walk rather than run, thrive rather than survive, and fail rather
    than not try.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am presently employed as
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenpmurray" target="_blank">Director of Engineering</a>,
    one of the founding members of
    <a href="https://starry.com" target="_blank">Starry</a>.
    Our founding team is a group that was responsible for developing
    and launching Aereo. And now we're building <a href="https://starry.com/internet" target="_blank">a radical new internet service</a>
    delivering gigabit speeds over a completely wireless infrastructure that leverages
    millimeter wave technology.
  </p>

    If that sounds interesting to you and you love JavaScript — we should
    talk, <a href="https://starry.com/careers" target="_blank">I'm hiring</a>.
